# Web scraping - Amazon product search result
This project uses selenium for scraping multiple amazon product search result pages and then stores
the items' data found into sqlite3 database.

# Project Motivation
We usually spend a lot of time searching for products we want. Scrolling through many pages to see if
there are products that have reasonable prices and good ratings for you. Web-scraping can do it instead of us.

# Files Description
- run.py - code for scraping multiple pages
- database.py - code for storing data into a database
- amazon_search.db - data collected in the sql database form. You can easily open it via www.sqliteonline.com
